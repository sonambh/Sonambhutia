Skilled in data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, I specialize in using **Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau** to identify patterns and trends to uncover insights. I am excited to bring my skills and further learn and grown in the field of analytics. In my spare time I enjoy winding down with a good book, and I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. 
This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects and to track my progress in analytics.
